# Digital-transmission-system-via-BPSK-scheme-in-a-wireless-fading-channel



Assume, you are asked to implement a digital transmission system via BPSK scheme in a wireless fading channel with second order diversity (L=2). Consider the following conditions.

(a) The fading follows the Rayleigh statistics.

(b) The additive noise is white Gaussian with a two-sided PSD of N/2.

(c) The diversity branches have independent channel gains & noise components.

Now, answer the followings.

(1) Simulate the BER V SNR performance for BPSK scheme under a simple Rayleigh Fading Channel (without diversity i.e. L-1). Use the SNR values ranging from -20 dB to 50dB and plot it under the same plotting window

(2) Simulate the BER vs SNR for the BPSK scheme with 2nd order diversity (L=2) using a suitable linear combining You can choose any of the maximal ratio combining, selective combining and equal gain combining techniques. Justify your choice

(3) Plot the BER vs SNR performance obtained in Q(2) using the same range of SNR and under the same plotting window with the previous BER plot of Q(1).
